This Pokemon data set provides basic information on 721 Pokemon up to the 6th generation in the Pokemon games (not including Pokemon Go or the Pokemon card game). The data set includes the Pokemon name, number, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. In Pokemon, you play as a Pokemon trainer who catches and trains Pokemons to build a team in order to defeat foes/gym leaders. Different aspects of a Pokemon may make them more desirable to include on your team. With this data set, I wanted to understand if there was any balancing of basic stats so that not just a handful of Pokemons were the chasers of the game. To explore this, I asked 3 specific questions that I wanted to answer with R:

1) Is there a strongest type of pokemon?

2) Is there an inverse relationship between Special Attack and Special Defense?

3) Is there an inverse relationship between Special Attack and Speed?

Sorry I am having trouble recording and uploading my video from my laptop and mayb have to do so once I go home to my desktop later today.
